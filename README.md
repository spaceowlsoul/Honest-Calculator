# :computer: Honest-Calculator

There's no need to explain what a calculator is.

Perhaps this is one of the first computers a one comes across in their life.

This program represents the basic functionality of a calculator and allows you to perform four main operations:
- addition;
- subtraction;
- multiplication;
- division.

In addition to the aforementioned operations, it can also save the result of the operation in its memory to use it later!

But what's honest about this calculator? Why is it called that? :raised_eyebrow:

## A quick guide

To start download and run the 'Honest_Calculator.py' file. 

Enter an equation you'd like to find the answer to.

If the operation is considered too easy to use a calculator to solve, the program outputs the result but with unpleasant feedback.

So think twice before using this calculating machine to multiply 2 by 2 :smirk:

And even thrice before saving the result in the program memory. It might not want to put it in memory!

Be polite and use the program wisely!
